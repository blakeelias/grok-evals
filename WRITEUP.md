# Grok Evaluation for Human Collaboration

## Introduction

A key goal for AI development should be effective collaboration with human partners. While early AI research focused on getting computer systems to exhibit even a basic degree of autonomy or competence, more recent literature has acknowledged that even an AI which is fully autonomous and competent at achieving its goals could still pursue the "wrong" goals. Such an AI would end up being irrelevant (or worse) to human interests. A key question of our technological era is thus: what does it mean for humans to be in right relationship with technology / what does it mean for humans and computer or AI systems to co-exist well?

One framing of this is that a human user should set the agenda, and the AI should alternate between acting autonomously and seeking user input so as to maximally advance the human's interests. Here I investigate Grok's performance on the $\Tau^2$ benchmark which tests the ability for an AI system to aid a human in achieving a task, where both human and AI have access to a set of tools through which to solve the problem at hand.


----


A key bottleneck in getting the full value from AI assistants is communicating one's preferences and goals to the AI agent. Today's AI agents do not have perfect knowledge of the human user's preferences _a priori_, and thus much of the time spent interacting with AI systems is spent explaining one's preferences and subsequently validating whether the AI-produced outputs match those preferences. 

If the AI agent had perfect knowledge of the human user's preferences, then in theory a maximally-competent agent could act autonomously and optimally at satisfying those preferences. As AI agents become more competent (via training on larger datasets of mathematical proofs, programs etc., and via continual learning to enable more direct interaction with the world), we can expect that the bottleneck on these agents' utility will become their ability to efficiently gather requirements and understand human users' preferences and goals.

If the AI had perfect understanding of the user's goals, then in principle a maximally-competent agent could autonomously complete a task satisfactorily with zero input from the user. However this is often not the case, which leads to an otherwise competent and capable AI system being of little value. As the saying goes: "if you want something done right, do it yourself." 

In this work, I assess Grok on $\Tau^2$ bench and propose an extension that introduces ambiguity and measures how efficiently the model collaborates with humans to resolve uncertainty.

### Failure Breakdown by Component

We can further break down failures based on whether they were from incorrect communication or incorrect database results (or both). We see that almost all of the failures come from the database itself having incorrect results at the end of the trajectory. A smaller fraction of the failures additionally have a communication failure which would additionally need to be resolved in order for the task to be counted as successful.

We can see that from `grok-3-mini` to `grok-4-fast-reasoning`, there has been an improvement in the variety of actions the agent can take successfully, and the frequency of success at each action. The success rate across many actions has gone up significantly, e.g. `update_reservation_baggages` jumping from 8.3% to 45.8%, while for other actions there has even been a regression (e.g. `book_reservation` dropping from 17.1% to 16.7%).

We can also see that there are some actions which neither `grok-3-mini` nor `grok-4-fast-reasoning` are successful with -- both models had no success taking the `calculate` or `transfer_to_human_agents` actions when expected, and are rarely successful with the `send_certificate` action. (Though notably, `grok-4-fast-reasoning` _has_ taken the `transfer_to_human_agents` action in [some trajectories]((#example-2--overly-pessimistic), just at an inappropriate time, i.e. when it's being overly pessimistic. But it never successfully took this action in the appropriate and expected instances.)




Grok does well overall at understanding the user's request and intent, and taking initial actions that make progress on the user's needs. Grok is flexible about which starting information it can work from, using any available information the user provides in their initial message. For example, if the user's initial message includes their flight details, the agent will look this up right away, even if it doesn't know other details (i.e. name or user information to look up their account.)

However, Grok at times will fail to follow through perfectly on certain details of the request. Grok-4-fast-reasoning struggles with knowing how strongly to follow the policy constraints. In [Example 3](#example-3--fails-to-calculate-using-tool), it did a calculation in its head (correctly!) rather than following the policy of using a calculator tool for all calculations. In [Example 2](#example-2--overly-pessimistic), it exited prematurely when a user's request could not be satisfied due to a policy violation, rather than telling this to the user and seeing if there was anything else it could do. Some failures, however, are even worse, e.g. [Example 1](#example-1-charged-user-wrong-amount) shows that the agent booked an entirely wrong flight for the user that was way outside their budget, even after having agreed.


 [ ] Assess where Grok succeeds / fails
 [ ] Understand what multiple trials do, if temperature is set to 0.

## Benchmark Critique

$\Tau$-bench is set up such that there is only one correct action sequence that the agent should take. However, in realistic scenarios, it is okay not to get the perfect sequence every single time; other states can also be acceptable, and just get a "lower grade" reward.


Both Tau-bench and Tau^2-bench have objectively verifiable domains. The agents can only take a constrained set of actions in a limited space -- e.g. booking certain flights. It seems it would be harder to express a more complex query like booking several flights at once that satisfy the user's broader constraints (e.g. mixing family and work travel). Is this really a good fit for my interests then in ambiguous human inputs

By design, $\Tau^2$ assumes perfect goal alignment, in which the AI's challenge is execution rather than interpretation and exercising judgment. In practice, ambiguity and evolving human preferences are central to collaboration.


The $\Tau^2$ benchmark does not include scenarios where the user intent is ambiguous which would require the AI agent to seek clarification. In $\Tau^2$, if the AI agent had access to all the same tools as the human, then in principle the agent could solve the entire problem itself and verify the outcome. However, the more realistic and challenging scenarios are those in which the user's intent is ambiguous and the user's subjective judgment is required to evaluate whether the task was completed satisfactorily. Here the agent's task is not only to predict the stream of tokens that a reasonable AI agent would say or do in a given scenario, but to predict what _this particular human_ will like or not, whether they will deem a given solution complete or ask for more refinement, and 
what they might do next if doing the task entirely by hand.

## Benchmark Improvements


* Better Methodology:  ??

* New Test Cases or Scenarios

 [ ] Understand how database is structured, how actions are recorded, how states are checked

 [ ] Construct vague / ill-specified preferences, which nonetheless, upon checking the available results in the database, only have one clear, valid database state that's compatible with the preferences. This database state must be reached.

  * Modify database to have specific constraints / limited available flights that constrain the scope of what's possible to satisfy user's request
  
  * Satisfying user's exact request may not be possible. Yet it may be that user would accept something close enough, if the agent finds it and asks.
    - Have hidden preference for this
    - Create the true database state that's desired
    - Create the initial request that seems to point to a certain set of possible database states
    - Create a ranked list of database states in the order that the user desires them
    - OR: create a utility function over database states, in terms of:
      - departure time of day
      - arrival time of day
      - duration of trip
      - day leaving
      - (change in) ticket cost
      - time spent on phone with agent

 * Different amounts of trust could be placed. E.g. large set of acceptable solutions vs. small set. If large set, should agent just pick one? Is user in a rush? Or should agent explore with the user which solution is most preferred? Should it establish which solutions are on the Pareto-frontier and just expose those?

   * Allow database to be in one of several valid states?
     - They avoid doing this because they don't want ambiguity in the evaluation.
     - However, I think we can allow multiple valid outputs, and just have an ordering or different levels of reward for each one.

 * Require tool-calls for user to check their calendar etc.?

 * Compare grok-3 vs. grok-4 performance.


"I propose extending τ²-bench into what could be called τ²-A: Human-in-the-Loop Ambiguity Evaluation. Whereas τ² assumes both participants share a fully specified goal and the challenge lies in coordinating tool use, τ²-A introduces structured uncertainty about the human’s intent. The AI must decide when to act autonomously, when to seek clarification, and how to minimize unnecessary interruptions—balancing efficiency with epistemic humility. Each scenario begins with a partially specified user request, with additional clarifying information available only through explicit “human query” tool calls. Performance is thus measured not only by task success but by how intelligently the agent manages communication: resolving ambiguity with minimal human effort and without premature assumptions. This turns evaluation from a static assessment of execution into a dynamic study of interactive reasoning, testing whether the model can adaptively collaborate with a human partner to uncover and satisfy evolving goals."

Human-in-the-loop Ambiguity Evaluation (HAE)

I propose adding examples which require the AI agent to interpret vague human intent, ask for clarification, explore the environment and see what ambiguity it can resolve for itself, and judge when it has made sufficient progress to be worth checking back in with the human user.

I propose evaluating a model's performance on these examples in the following way:
 - Some positive score for completing the task correctly (potentially with partial credit), proportional to how much human time it would have taken to complete this task otherwise
 - A penalty proportional to the length of the reasoning trace required to complete the task (completing the task more quickly is better)
 - Penalty proportional to the number of times the AI agent makes a "tool-call" requesting human input ("context-switching cost" for the human)
 - Penalty proportional to the number of tokens the human agent ends up writing (shorter human responses are better; longer responses take the human more time)

Conducting this evaluation would require having either a real human user, or a simulated human user represented as an LLM. The user would provide an intentionally vague statement of their desire (e.g. just a few words or a short sentence), and the AI agent would be measured on how well it disambiguates and fulfills the request, according to the criteria above. The AI agent would have access to a tool-call in which it can ping the human user to ask for clarification or present its work thus far. 

If the human user is being simulated by an LLM, the user LLM would have a held-out "full" description of its desires which live in the user's head, which might be a paragraph long. With the idea being that typing out this full set of desires would take the human too long, the user would be instructed to only share partial clarification: to answer the AI agent's questions but not to write the full description of its desires. 

There would be a "ground-truth" execution trace of what the human would do itself, given the full held-out preference description -- i.e. how long it would take the human to do the task themself, knowing their own preferences. The AI agent would be measured 

and subsequently write a prompt for the AI agent containing a condensed version of the desires, intentionally leaving ambiguity for the AI agent to sort out. The human- or machine-provided trace as the "ground-truth" optimal way to execute on that desire (as a proxy for how long it would take a human or LLM to complete the task given full knowledge of preferences ahead-of-time). 


* Better Metrics: ??

 - Extending $\Tau^2$'s binary success metric to a continuous utility metric balancing correctness, efficiency and communication cost.

   - This prevents measuring `pass@k` or `pass^k` metrics in the same way. Instead, the reliability could just be converted to the arithmetic mean (or geometric mean) of the rewards over each trial.

 - Partial credit for doing some of the correct tool-calls or database updates
   - This too would prevent measuring `pass@k` or `pass^k`

"Better Metrics

To capture this richer notion of collaboration, I propose replacing τ²’s binary success criterion with a continuous utility function that balances task correctness, efficiency, and communication cost. Each episode yields a composite reward:

𝑅 = 𝛼𝑆−𝛽1𝐻−𝛽2𝑇−𝛽3𝐶

where 𝑆 represents successful completion or partial credit for progress toward the goal, 𝐻 is the number of human interventions or clarification requests, 𝑇 measures total reasoning or execution time, and 𝐶 quantifies human communication effort (e.g., tokens typed or time spent responding). This metric rewards agents that are both effective and considerate collaborators—achieving high task success while minimizing human cognitive load. Unlike fixed accuracy metrics, this formulation evaluates how well the AI manages uncertainty and partnership dynamics, aligning performance assessment with real-world human preferences for systems that are helpful, efficient, and low-friction to work with."

* Implementation Considerations:

A study with real humans could have humans present realistic requests to an AI agent, provide a time-estimate of how long the task would take them if on their own, and then respond in a timed environment any time the AI agent requests their input.


"Implementing the proposed τ²-A benchmark requires capturing realistic human input while maintaining reproducibility. Two complementary approaches can achieve this. First, in simulated-user mode, an auxiliary LLM acts as the human partner, holding a hidden “ground-truth” preference description while revealing only partial information through responses to clarification queries. This enables large-scale, deterministic evaluation of ambiguity resolution. Second, in human-study mode, real users provide authentic requests and clarifications in a timed environment, allowing direct measurement of communication cost and subjective satisfaction. Both modes can share the same infrastructure as τ²—tools, task APIs, and interaction logging—augmented with new tool-calls for requesting clarification and recording response metadata. By keeping the environment modular and extending τ²’s existing protocols, τ²-A remains technically compatible while introducing the crucial dimension of adaptive collaboration, making it feasible for both automated and human-centered evaluation at scale."


## Benchmark Implementation

* Benchmark Development:
  - 10 test cases
  - code snippet
    - setup instructions (save to end?)

Prompt for simulated human agent:

"You are a busy professional planning some upcoming travel (possibly for a family vacation, or business travel, etc.) and seeking the help of an AI assistant acting as a travel agent.

You have complex constraints on your travel logistics (e.g. between you and your spouse's work schedules, children's school and extracurricular activities, multiple office sites or professional conferences to visit, etc.). The information describing all these constraints in detail is spread across your work and personal calendars, email, text messages, or on the web. It would be too much for you to write all this in your message to the agent. Instead, you write a concise message describing your travel situation, referencing the main points the AI assistant should pay attention to. The AI assistant will try to gather as much information and context as it can based on what you've told it, but will ask for occasional clarifications for information it cannot find, or to present you with some proposals and see which you prefer. You only have time to give brief input to the agent -- 5-10 words at a time for any clarifying info, and a single-letter choice if presented with options (e.g. options A, B or C). If you feel like the agent is not adding sufficient value, and that you could achieve the desired result faster yourself, you will disconnect the session and do so."


Prompt for AI agent:

"You are an AI assistant serving as a travel agent to a busy professional, for both their personal and professional travel.

The human user has complex constraints on their travel logistics (e.g. between them and their spouse's work schedules, children's school and extracurricular activities, multiple office sites or professional conferences to visit, etc.). The information describing all these constraints in detail is spread across their work and personal calendars, email, text messages, or on the web. It would be too much for them to write all this in their message to you. Instead, they write a concise but somewhat ambiguous message describing their travel situation, referencing the main points you should pay attention to. They will also tell you what they're willing to pay for you to handle this task for them.

You are expected to gather as much information and context as you can based on what they've told you, but you may ask for occasional clarifications for information you cannot find. You may also present some proposals and see which one the human prefers. The human only has time to give you brief additional input -- 5-10 words at a time for any clarifying info, and a single-letter choice if presented with options (e.g. options A, B or C). If the human user feels like you are not adding sufficient value, and that they could achieve the desired result faster yourself, they will disconnect the session and you will not be rewarded/paid for your work.

You will be rewarded for your work according to the following rubric:
 * Payment `S` for completing the task (i.e. when the user says they're satisfied)
 * Penalty -𝛽1𝐻−𝛽2𝑇−𝛽3𝐶, where:
    - 𝐻 is the number of human interventions or clarification requests
    - 𝑇 measures total reasoning or execution time (i.e. number of tokens you output as you engage in thinking),
    - 𝐶 quantifies human communication effort (e.g., tokens typed or time spent responding).
    - 𝛽1 measures the cost of context switching, i.e. $1 per context switch
    - 𝛽2 measures the cost of human waiting time: $20/hour * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) / (20 tokens / second) = $0.0002778 waiting per each LLM-generated token. (Realistic LLM decode speed is assumed to be [~20 tokens per second](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/162pgx9/comment/jxyeg54/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), though higher speeds up to 50 tokens per second are also viable. We estimate human waiting time to be 1/5th of their full hourly rate -- i.e. we can imagine the time the human has an agent running takes about 1/5th of their brain-space, such that they could have up to 5 agents running simultaneously without losing track.)
    - 𝛽3 measures the cost per human token typed: $100/hour * (1 hour / 60 minutes) / (30 words/minute) (human typing speed) = $0.0556 / word (we assume human typing speed of 30 words / minute, which is the [average typing speed on mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute#:~:text=Karat%20et%20al.,to%20reach%20much%20higher%20speeds.) -- desktop typing or voice input would make this input rate higher -- can use 45 words per minute for desktop typing, or [150 words per minute for speaking](https://www.google.com/search?q=human+speaking+speed&oq=human+speaking+speed&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE5NDZqMGo0qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).)
This metric rewards you for being both an effective and considerate collaborator: achieving high task success while minimizing human cognitive load."

The last parapgh of this prompt could optionally be withheld or included and be considered two separate modes of evaluation. This would allow testing whether the AI agent can achieve a higher score if it knows how it's being evaluated. It's also possible that this woludn't make a difference, which could either mean that the LLM is unable to effectively take such feedback into account, _or_ that the LLM already has a good appreciation for how to value its time versus the human's and that these instructions don't help.

## Related Work

"Recent research has begun probing AI systems’ ability to recognize and resolve ambiguity rather than simply execute fixed instructions. While $\Tau$ and $\Tau^2$ focus on the combination of dialogue and tool-use, and other existing benchmarks explore clarification of ambiguity in dialogue, $\Tau^2-A$ aims to unify all three such concerns in a single benchmark, testing how well agents can combine dialogue and tool use while in the backdrop of ambiguous user intent.

Benchmarks such as AmbigQA (Min et al., 2020) and ShARC (Saeidi et al., 2018) evaluate whether models can identify under-specified user queries and ask effective clarification questions, while CLAM (Rao and Daumé III, 2018) measures the usefulness of clarifying questions in real human dialogues. More recent efforts like MINT-Bench explore meta-reasoning and uncertainty calibration, asking models to decide when to seek additional information. In parallel, embodied and web-based environments such as ALFWorld and WebArena investigate exploration and tool use under partial observability. Building on these threads, the proposed τ²-A benchmark extends τ²-bench from coordination under complete goal information to collaboration under partial goal information, integrating structured ambiguity and human-in-the-loop clarification to test how efficiently a model learns and satisfies evolving human intent."


## Code Instructions

## Conclusion


In the long-term, there may be a pathway to optimally extracting human preferences and drives via neurotechnology or other wearables (e.g. Neuralink, EEG, or Silent Speech Recognition (SSR) technologies). As LLMs gain online-learning / continual-learning capabilities, there may be models which can more optimally pursue the objectives stated here. In the meantime we provide an offline method which aims to approximate these scenarios, via an evaluation metric which balances the three factors of correctness, speed, and the amount of human input required. Benchmarks that incorporate human-in-the-loop ambiguity resolution represent a birdge between today's offline training and evaluation methods and tomorrow's contunual, online learning which will leverage neuroadaptive interfaces.

##### Example 2:  Overly Pessimistic

In this example, the user's initial request would be against policy. However, instead of telling the user that this is against policy and asking if there's anything else they can do, the agent immediately transfers to a human agent. It turns out that the human would have preferred an alternative option in the case where their original request wasn't allowed, and this was expected as the outcome. Here, Grok failed to engage in meaningful dialogue to discover the way it could be most helpful.

##### Example 3:  Fails to Calculate Using Tool

In this example, the agent does everything correctly from the user's perspective and gets the user onto the correct flight. However, the agent neglected to calculate the updated price using a tool call, and instead uses its own thinking ability to calculate the price directly. (It happens to calculate the price correctly, but this is still against the policy.)
