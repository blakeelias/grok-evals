# Grok Evaluation for Human Collaboration

## Introduction

A key goal for AI development should be effective collaboration with human partners. While early AI research focused on getting computer systems to exhibit even a basic degree of autonomy or competence, more recent literature has acknowledged that even an AI which is fully autonomous and competent at achieving its goals could still pursue the "wrong" goals. Such an AI would end up being irrelevant (or worse) to human interests. A key question of our technological era is thus: what does it mean for humans to be in right relationship with technology / what does it mean for humans and computer or AI systems to co-exist well?

One framing of this is that a human user should set the agenda, and the AI should alternate between acting autonomously and seeking user input so as to maximally advance the human's interests. Here I investigate Grok's performance on the $\Tau^2$ benchmark which tests the ability for an AI system to aid a human in achieving a task, where both human and AI have access to a set of tools through which to solve the problem at hand.
