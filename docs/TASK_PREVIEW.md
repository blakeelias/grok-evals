I've passed my first technical interview with xAI. This is the information I received for the second round. 

"Hi Blake, Great job on passing the first few rounds of the interview process! The next step in our process is the take-home assessment, titled "Evaluating Grok and Improving Benchmarks." This is a 48-hour, open-ended project where you’ll select and analyze an AI benchmark, assess Grok’s performance, critique the benchmark’s limitations, propose improvements, and implement a revised version (note, the 48 hours is meant to give you plenty of time to tackle the problem, but you do not need to use all of it). You are free to use any tools or development environment that best suits your workflow, such as Cursor, your preferred IDE, or others. We will require use of Grok in the assessment. This will be accessible via console.x.ai using the promo code sent to your inbox for free credits to use our API. To begin, please click the link provided in the CodeSignal email, which includes the prompt, technical requirements, and submission details. Your deliverable will be a document summarizing your analysis, proposed improvements, code implementing the revised benchmark, a failure case analysis for Grok, and commands to replicate results. Please submit your writeup and materials via a link to a public GitHub repository, ensuring the last commit is made within the 48-hour window from when you start the assessment. For detailed task instructions, including the list of preferred AI benchmarks and guidelines, refer to the CodeSignal prompt. For API-related questions, see https://docs.x.ai/docs/overview. If you have any other questions, please contact cdalton@x.ai. Thank you, and I’m looking forward to reviewing your work! You can take the assessment at your convenience before at 11:53am PDT on Wednesday, September 24th using the link below."
